# Sudoku

A Sudoku solver with Backtrack algorithm for ```nxn``` Sudoku. 

The solver works for ```nxn``` but it's take longe to done it, for ```4x4``` and ```9x9``` works fine but for 16x16 and more not recommended 

To run the code compile the file with ```python3 <file_name>```

In the file there are already 3 Sudokus, ```4x4```, ```9x9``` and ```16x16```, to print it in a readable way <br>
just use the function ```print_board(mat)``` and pass the sudoku into it
